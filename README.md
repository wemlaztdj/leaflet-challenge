# leaflet-challenge


## Background

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) provides scientific data concerning natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. In an effort to better visualize the massive amount of earthquake data collected globally, the USGS has initiated this challenge to develop a set of tools for visualizing earthquake data. This would aid in educating the public and other governmental organizations, hopefully securing more funding for addressing planetary issues.
